# touchtog

This bash script finds the current enabled state of a touchpad/trackpad on a linux device and then switched that state to the opposite state.

Disclaimer: You MAY have to change the case of the word "Touchpad" in the code to "TouchPad" depending on your system. Personally, I had two touchpad devices (one synaptics, the other the physical device) and they had different cases, the physical one is what worked for me)

For most linux distrobutions, you should be able to place this script in any directory, then bind the command to a hotkey.
